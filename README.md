# NetMedia
NetMedia is a Ruby project that will allow you to share media files over a local network. It involves a server (probably connected to a TV or monitor) and various client computers that share specific folders with the server. The server can request the files from the clients and play them with a media player on the connected display.

NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND WILL NIT FUNCTION PROPERLY> NOT ALL FEATURES ABOVE HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET.
