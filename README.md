# NetMedia
NetMedia is a Ruby and Android project that will allow you to share media files over a local network. It involves a server (probably connected to a TV or monitor) and various client computers that share specific folders with the server. The server can request the files from the clients and play them with a media player on the connected display. The Android application acts as the remote control for the server's actions.

NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY. NOT ALL FEATURES ABOVE HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET.
